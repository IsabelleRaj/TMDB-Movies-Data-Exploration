## Project Description
This project conducts exploratory data analysis on the TMDB movies dataset, using Python and its data manipulation and visualisation libraries. 

The project focuses on insights such as the most successful production companies by movie count and total revenue, and a comparison of the most and least popular movies. 

## Installation
1. Open your command prompt.
2. Navigate to your desired directory.
3. Git clone this repository using the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/IsabelleRaj/TMDB-Movies-Data-Exploration
   ```

## Usage
1. Open the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook TMDB_project.ipynb
   ```
2. Follow the steps in the notebook to replicate the analysis.

## Data Source
The data was downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata), though it was originally sourced from the TMDB website, using their [official API](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs/getting-started). 

*Ensure you have the dataset downloaded and placed in the appropriate directory.*
